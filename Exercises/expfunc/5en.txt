A barometer is calibrated by taking two measurements: One at sea
level, reading 1.013bar, and one at a station 876m above sea level,
reading 0.908bar.

The calibrated barometer is now used to calculate the height of a
high rise, again by taking two measurements: one on the ground
floor, reading 0.976bar, and one on the roof, reading 0.957 bar.

To calculate the height of the buildig two models can be used. One
assumes a linear decrease in air pressure, and the other, more
complicated model assumes an exponential decrease. Calculate the
height of the building with both models.
