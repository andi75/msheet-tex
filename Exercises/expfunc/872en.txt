Tritium is a radiactive isotope of hydrogen. Its half-life is approximately
12.35 years. It is created by solar radiation in the upper atmosphere and
reaches the ground in the form of rainfall. At 68m below the surface, a sample
of ice was taken from a glacier. It contained only 5\% of the
usual amount of tritium found in fresh water. How old is the sample?
